Here are some miscellaneous notes I have written throughout my career that have not or will not see the light of day as publications, their purpose is solely to inform myself and/or fulfill graduate school requirements:

* [Introduction to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Gauge theories](../files/Z2_Gauge_theories.pdf)
* [Strange Metals and SYK models](../files/Strange_Metals_and_SYK_models.pdf)
